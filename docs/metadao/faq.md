# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. Futarchy Questions

### Q: Will futarchy always be correct?
**A:** Sometimes futarchy might pick the wrong decision in hindsight. That's ok if there is no better governance mechanism.

### Q: Ok this is amazing, should everything be governed by a futarchy?
**A:** No, see Vitalik's [blog post](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/09/20/daos.html) on DAO types.

### Q: This sounds like plutocracy, does this just benefit the rich?
**A:** No. Futarchy has strong protection for small minorities. For a given decision to pass, the minority has to be offered exit liquidity above or at the spot price.

## 2. MetaDAO Questions

### Q: I am a leader can I test this out first before giving up power to the markets?
**A:** Yes, you could start by using decision markets for something small, such as grants. However, we believe that markets will eventually trade companies that aren't futarchies at a discount.

### Q: Doesn't evaluating the effects of proposals divert energy from other things?
**A:** We have CEOs, so not everything needs to be a proposal. If the proposal is obviously good or bad, then you can rely on profit-seeking actors to reprice the markets.

Here are our spam filters to keep out neutral proposals:
- Pass needs to beat fail by x%.
- There is an exponential fee to create proposals when current ones are ongoing.
- The proposer has to supply AMM liquidity.
- The proposer will lose money if the proposal fails.
- The house always wins as there is a 1% fee on all trades.

Soon:
- Proposal trading only during certain periods.

### Q: Have any other crypto projects tried to use prediction markets for governance?
**A:** Yes, but they did not follow Robin Hanson's model of asset-driven futarchy. They were also built on older blockchains; we now have the benefit of years of infrastructure development and cost reductions.
