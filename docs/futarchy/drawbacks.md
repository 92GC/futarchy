# Drawbacks

But of course, futarchy isn't perfect. These are some potential pitfalls with the approach.

### Keynesian Beauty Contests

Sometimes, investors buy what they think others will buy, not what they think the fundamentals support. The housing bubble of the mid 2000's is an example of this, and many more can be found in crypto.

This is less of an issue in crypto as token supply is elastic and any member of the DAO can create a proposal for toke dilution or buy backs. Another potential solution is to facilitate information dissemination by giving top traders a box to leave comments in the UI.

### Conditional Markets are Zero-Sum

Futarchy uses conditional markets, which are zero-sum: any gain you have in the market is someone else's loss. Since intelligent market participants don't engage in zero-sum games, this will constrict liquidity and participation in futarchic markets.

You may be able to resolve this by providing an incentive to trade or provide liquidity in the markets. Because the futarchy creates positive externalities (good decisions), this incentive can be sustainable.

### Scalability

Futarchy is good for big decisions like whether to fire the CEO, but not as good for smaller decisions like whether to fire a division leader because those actions are usually too inconsequential to reflect in the share price.

A solution to this problem is described in MetaDAO's whitepaper.

### Multisig
In its current state, MetaDAO still relies on multisig members. When a proposal passes, it will often require the transaction of funds from the multisig. We hope to eventually eliminate the need for the multisig as an intermediary and pass all power to the autocrat and formally verified proposals as smart contracts.
